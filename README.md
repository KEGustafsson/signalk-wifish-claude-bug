# signalk-wifish

Signal K plugin and web app for the Raymarine **Wi-Fish** and **Dragonfly-4/5/7 Pro**
Wi-Fi sonars. It does what the Android "Wi-Fish" app does, in a browser on any
device connected to your Signal K server:

- live **CHIRP sonar** and **DownVision** echograms, side by side or one at a time
- depth and water temperature readout, and both published to **Signal K**
- sonar adjustments sent to the unit: gain, contrast and noise filter (each with Auto),
  range (auto or shallow/deep), transducer depth and the unit's simulator
- pause and scroll back through history, pinch or mouse-wheel zoom with a zoom box,
  A-scope, depth lines, nine colour palettes, snapshots

**Status:** protocol derived from static analysis of the Android app; hardware validation in
progress. A built-in demo sonar lets you try everything without a unit.

## How it works

The sonar is a Wi-Fi access point. The machine running Signal K joins that network
(ideally on a second Wi-Fi interface, so Ethernet or another Wi-Fi stays the default
route, see [network setup](docs/network-setup.md)). The plugin listens for the sonar's
multicast announcement, keeps the session alive, decodes the "Sonar4" UDP protocol
([docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md)) and:

- publishes `environment.depth.belowTransducer` and `environment.water.temperature`
  (plus `environment.depth.belowSurface` or `belowKeel` when a transducer offset is set
  on the unit),
- streams echogram columns to the **Wi-Fish Sonar** web app, keeping recent history on the
  server so a browser opened later can scroll back,
- relays settings changes from the web app to the unit.

## Install

From the Signal K App Store search for **signalk-wifish**, or:

```sh
cd ~/.signalk
npm install signalk-wifish
```

Restart the server, enable **Wi-Fish / Dragonfly sonar** under *Server → Plugin Config*,
then open **Wi-Fish Sonar** from the *Webapps* page (`http://<server>:3000/signalk-wifish/`).

### Plugin options

| Option | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| Data source | `device` | `device` = the sonar on the joined Wi-Fi, `demo` = built-in simulated sonar, `replay` = a raw capture file |
| Wi-Fi interface address | empty | local IPv4 on the sonar Wi-Fi; empty picks the `192.x` address on the sonar's subnet, like the app |
| Control the sonar | on | send keepalives and settings; off = passive listener |
| Replay file | empty | absolute path of a capture made with `tools/wifish-probe.mjs --log` |
| Demo model | `dragonfly` | `dragonfly` (sonar + DownVision) or `wifish` (DownVision only) |
| History columns per channel | 1500 | echogram history kept on the server |
| Publish depth / water temperature | on | Signal K output |

Depth is sent on change (at most 5 Hz, 5 s heartbeat) and as `null` when the bottom is
lost or data stops, so displays don't show a stale depth; temperature at most once per
second with a 10 s heartbeat.

## Using the web app

The screen follows the Android app:

| | |
|---|---|
| Toolbar | view switcher, pause/resume, snapshot, and ⋯ for Settings, Help and About. On a Wi-Fish (DownVision only) the first button opens the sonar settings instead. |
| Tap a trace | shows its ⚙ button for 5 s; it opens the **Sensitivity / Range / Options** popover for that channel |
| Drag sideways | scroll back through history (pauses); ⏩ or dragging to the end returns to live |
| Pinch vertically / mouse wheel | zoom into the water column; the zoom box on the right shows the full range and follows the bottom. Double-tap to zoom out. |
| Pinch horizontally / Ctrl + wheel | scroll speed |
| Press and hold | depth, bottom, water temperature and time at that point |
| ⋯ → Settings | transducer depth, depth and temperature units, simulator |

Palettes, units, view and similar preferences are stored per browser.

## Development

Node.js 20+.

```sh
npm install          # also builds
npm test             # vitest
npm run dev          # web app with the demo sonar on http://localhost:3000/
node dist/devserver.js --demo --wifish            # Wi-Fish (DownVision only)
node dist/devserver.js --device [--iface 192.168.x.y] [--passive] [--deltas]
node dist/devserver.js --replay capture.bin
npm run watch:web    # rebuild the web app on change
```

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| [`src/sonar4.ts`](src/sonar4.ts) | pure protocol codec: parsers, keepalive, settings read-modify-write, ping reassembly |
| [`src/session.ts`](src/session.ts) | protocol state from any transport; builds settings commands |
| [`src/device.ts`](src/device.ts) | UDP transport: discovery, keepalive, reconnect |
| [`src/demo.ts`](src/demo.ts), [`src/replay.ts`](src/replay.ts) | demo sonar and capture replay transports |
| [`src/engine.ts`](src/engine.ts) | Signal K deltas, state and echogram history |
| [`src/api.ts`](src/api.ts), [`src/plugin.ts`](src/plugin.ts) | HTTP/SSE API and the plugin |
| [`web/`](web) | the web app (TypeScript, canvas, no framework), bundled to `public/` |
| [`tools/`](tools) | `wifish-probe.mjs` (hardware test client, raw logging) and `dump-raw.mjs` |
| [`docs/`](docs) | protocol and network setup |

### Probe tools

```sh
npm run build:server
node tools/wifish-probe.mjs --iface <wlan IP> --log raw.bin
node tools/wifish-probe.mjs --iface <wlan IP> --sk 127.0.0.1:<signalk udp port>
node tools/wifish-probe.mjs --iface <wlan IP> --no-keepalive   # passive test
node tools/wifish-probe.mjs --replay raw.bin                   # decode a capture, no device needed
node tools/dump-raw.mjs raw.bin --id 0x270104 --hex
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Validate on hardware; resolve ❓ fields in the protocol doc
- [ ] Confirm the transducer offset convention (depth reference)
- [x] Signal K server plugin (TypeScript, vitest)
- [x] Echogram stream and web UI
- [ ] Waypoints (the app syncs them from the Dragonfly over TCP) as Signal K resources
